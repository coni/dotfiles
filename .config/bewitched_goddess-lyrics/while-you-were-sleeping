I still can't believe that you noticed me an ocean away
The heavens would say it was meant to be
I'll never forget the first time I saw you then
Primrose at three, you had all of me
Without saying a word
I don't recognize myself
I'm dancing down streets
Smiling to strangers
Idiotic things
I trace it all back, three-thirty AM
That night, something turned in my heart
While you were sleeping, I fell in love
I can't quite believe you think I'm beautiful
Must be a trick, a, "Tag and you're it", kind of foolery
Then you take my hand, kiss me on the cheek
A light pink bouquet, a promise you'll stay
And I start to believe
I don't recognize myself
I'm writing a love song
Who've I become?
There must be something wrong
I trace it all back, three-thirty AM
That night, something turned in my heart
While you were sleeping, I fell in love
