Should've figured
That you'd go back to New York
Don't consider me
When you run back to her
You don't have to hide it
I know why you went
Said you needed space
I know better than that, mmm
Could've fought for you
But I just let you leave
Hurt too much to consider
You didn't love me
The mountains of LA
Will weep through the night
Driving down Sunset's a terrible sight, mmm
Left me and the ocean for your old flame
Holding back my tears, I couldn't make you stay
Can't quit this, so damn wicked
To leave California and me
I imagine you holding her in your arms
Laughing 'bout how I thought that you were the one
I get so anxious and maybe I'm young
The first sign of trouble and I bite my tongue, mmm
Left me and the ocean for your old flame
Holding back my tears, I couldn't make you stay
Can't quit this, so damn wicked
To leave California and me
