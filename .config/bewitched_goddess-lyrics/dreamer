Let me be a dreamer
Let me float
I can see the whole world
From my own little cloud
Up by the Milky Way
I'll stay here forever and a day
You can't pin me down
I fear all solid ground
I'd rather be alone at tea
Love when nobody's makin' me, oh
Boys just make me cry
Believe me, I have tried
I've made my rounds
Kissed some mouths
Trust me, I don't want a single soul around, oh
I'm giving up, I'm throwing in my hat
I can't take another lifeless little chat
I'm moving up into a cloud, into my fantasy
And no boy's gonna be so smart as to
Try and pierce my porcelain heart
No boy's gonna kill the dreamer in me 
(Dreamer, dream)
Some might call me mad
The worst this town has had
I fell right down the rabbit hole
Legends say I fell so fast I lost my soul
Oh, my melancholic days 
Are few and far away 
I've had enough, called it off
As far as I'm concerned, this witch is numb to love, oh
I'm giving up, I'm throwing in my hat
I can't take another lifeless little chat
I'm moving up into a cloud, into my fantasy
And no boy's gonna be so smart as to
Try and pierce my porcelain heart
And no boy's gonna kill the dreamer in me
And no boy's gonna be so smart as to
Try and pierce my porcelain heart
No boy's gonna kill the dreamer in me
