Why don't we
Call it for what it is?
Can't remember the last time we kissed
And it tickled my heart
I think that it's best that we spend time apart
I just yawn
Listening to you
Talk about yourself again
And again
I'm bored
Bored of this love
Oh, I'm bored
Bored of this talk
And maybe you're just way too vain to be interesting
Baby, keep talkin' but nobody's listening
Don't mean to walk out the door
But, baby, I'm bored
Bored
Did you know (did you know)
I wept in my room last night?
Bet you didn't know you make me cry
'Cause you're so self-possessed
Charming at first, but you've made me depressed
So I'm leaving in the morning
'Cause I'm bored (bored)
Bored of this love, oh, I'm bored (bored)
Bored of this talk, and
Maybe you're just way too plain to be interesting
Baby, keep talkin' but nobody's listening
Don't mean to walk out the door
But, baby, I'm bored (bored)
You followed me out and said, "Darling, don't leave"
Your passionate monologue woke up the street
"I'll marry you someday, you're perfect for me"
I got in my car just to drown out your plea
'Cause I'm bored (bored)
Bored of this love, oh, I'm bored (bored)
Bored of this talk, and
Maybe you're just way too vain to be interesting
Baby, keep talkin' but nobody's listening
Don't mean to walk out the door
But, baby, I'm bored, oh
(Bored)
