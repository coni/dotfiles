I won't pretend, I've been desolate
I won't pretend, I've been blue
It happened so quickly, one second it hit me
I've fallen quite hard over you
I won't pretend, I've been anxious
Just like I've always been
This time, it's sticking
And time just stops ticking
When I have my arms around you
Four-leaf clovers and lucky dimes
Coincidences and cosmic signs
Have proved that I am quite naïve
I'm falling fast, failing gravity
And all that I see is serendipity
Ran into you on the corner
Of Ninety and Central Park West
Oh, how it thrilled me, I thank the big city
And, this, I will rarely confess
In years when we're losing our memory
The world's taken leaps over time
I hope that you'll look at me like I'm still twenty-three
Hope that you'll still be mine
Four-leaf clovers and lucky dimes
Coincidences and cosmic signs
Have proved that I am quite naïve
I'm falling fast, failing gravity
I swear that, this time, it's serendipity
Serendipity
Serendipity
