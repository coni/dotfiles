One more kiss, wine stained lips
I don't want to go to sleep yet
Pale moonlight, misty eyes
I'll allow myself to have him just tonight
I hold on to every ounce of sin
I know he don't love me quite like I love him
I swear to myself as he leaves at dawn
This will end, 'til he haunts me again
Rose perfume, low-lit room
I'll pretend you'll stay forever
Lay me down, ghostly sounds
Haunt the hallways as he wraps me around
And I hold on to every ounce of sin
I know he don't love me quite like I love him
I swear to myself as he leaves at dawn
This will end, 'til he haunts me again
