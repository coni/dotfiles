Don't you worry 'bout your curly hair
Clothes that don't quite fit you anywhere
Voices echo in the gym
Another girl's had her first kiss
Please don't think too much of it, darling
I'm so sorry that they pick you last
Try to say your foreign name and laugh
I know that you feel loud, so different from the crowd
Of big blue eyes, and long blonde hair, and boys that stare
But, baby, know that
You'll grow up
And grow so tough and charm them
Write your story, fall in love a little too
The things you thought you'd never do
I wish I could go back and give her a squeeze
Myself at thirteen
And just let her know, know that she's beautiful
Keep on going with your silly dream
Life is prettier than it may seem
One day, you'll be up on stage
Little girls will scream your name
The days of tears and failure fears
And no one cares
Will all make sense, 'cause
You'll grow up
And grow so confident, and
Write your story, fall in love a little too
The things you thought you'd never do
I wish I could go back and give her a squeeze
Myself at thirteen
And just let her know, know that she's beautiful
Ooh
