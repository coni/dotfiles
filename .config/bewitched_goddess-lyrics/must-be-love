Time's moving so much slower lately
It's like the world's playin' a joke
Laughing at me for falling foolishly again
But something's different with you
Traffic on Sunset doesn't phase me
I'm just unusually composed
That is until I touch you and I can't pretend
I lose myself again, I do
I'm all in, I'm fallin'
Can't get back up
Can't think right, too tongue-tied
It must be love
Friends asking me where I've been hiding
I'm losin' hours in your eyes
Lost in your wonderland, I hope I'm never found
There's no one else around, tonight
I'm not so used to being happy
Now I just float down every street
You made a sappy, stupid something out of me
The kind I swore I'd never be
I'm awake inside a dream
I'm all in, I'm fallin'
Can't get back up
Can't think right, too tongue-tied
Come kiss me, convince me
This must be, it must be love
Must be love
