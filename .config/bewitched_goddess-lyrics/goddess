It always goes like this
Could've predicted it
I'm so naive to think you loved me for me
Kissed as I ran off stage
Too old to play this game
Guess you're still growing up at thirty
Oh
Were you surprised by me
When you took me home?
When the glamor wore off
Reduced to skin and bone
I can't even tell
Who you want to know
I'm a goddess on stage
Human when we're alone
You took a star to bed
Woke up with me instead
You must have felt so damn deceived
When you made up a version of
Me that you thought you'd love
But I am not your Aphrodite
Oh
Were you surprised by me
When you took me home?
When the glamor wore off
Reduced to skin and bone
I can't even tell
Who you want to know
I'm a goddess on stage
Human when we're alone
You took me for a fool
You stole my youth
You wanted this so much
You watched me rise
Then killed my light
And now you know
I'm not your fucking goddess
Oh, oh
I'm no goddess when I'm alone
