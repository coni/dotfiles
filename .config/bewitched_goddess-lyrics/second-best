I'll never forget how stupid in love I felt
I'll always regret how I couldn't ever tell
That you walked a little faster, left me behind
Kissed me with somebody else in mind
I loved you so much
That I settled for less
Oh, you were my everything
I was your second best, mm
Lying awake, I'd watch as you'd dream at night (dream at night)
Nightingale singing half-hearted lullabies
Well, you swung me around in that midsummer dance
Held me in close as you thought of your past
I love way too much
Oh, this hurts to confess
Oh, you were my everything
I was your second best
You've given me nothing to miss
Honestly, life has been much better since
I spoke to you last
Why am I still wondering
If I stand a chance or if you'd have me back?
Everyone warned me you were a bad idea
I never listen
Maybe I will next year
When I've walked a little further into my life
Fallen in love and left you behind
But I'm still a little in love with this mess
Oh, you were my everything
I'm just your second best
Mm
Second best
