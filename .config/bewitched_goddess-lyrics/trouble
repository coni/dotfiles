I've been having trouble sleeping
Trouble dreaming, trouble being
I've been seeing double
Black and blue
The trouble is we never were
More than friends
Just a blur
I've been havin' trouble
Standing tall
Reaching for my phone
Just to have no one to call
Trouble with my mama
Asking how I am
How can I tell her I'm crying 'bout a man?
That's the trouble with having something to lose
I've been havin' trouble without you
I've been feeling foolish lately
My sister said, "Don't be a baby
Someday you'll have something real to lose"
I can't help the way I feel
'Cause for me, oh, this was real
Oh, every kind of trouble
Standin' tall
Honestly, it's trouble with anything at all
Talking to my mama
Asking how I am
I don't wanna tell her I'm crying 'bout a man
That's the trouble with having something to lose
I've been havin' trouble without you
That's the trouble with having something to lose
I've been havin' trouble without you
