Don't you notice how
I get quiet when there's no one else around?
Me and you and awkward silence
Don't you dare look at me that way
I don't need reminders of how you don't feel the same
Oh, the burning pain
Listening to you harp on 'bout some new soulmate
"She's so perfect"
Blah, blah, blah
Oh, how I wish you'll wake up one day
Run to me, confess your love
At least just let me say
That when I talk to you
Oh, Cupid walks right through
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon
But don't you feel it too?
Confess I loved you from the start
What's a girl to do?
Lying on my bed 
Staring into the blue
Unrequited, terrifying
Love is driving me a bit insane
Have to get this off my chest
I'm telling you today
That when I talk to you
Oh, Cupid walks right through
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon
But don't you feel it too?
Confess I loved you from the start
Confess I loved you
Just thinking of you
I know I've loved you from the start
